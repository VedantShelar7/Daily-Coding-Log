# 🧠 My Daily Python Coding Streak

Welcome to my personal coding streak! I'm building one mini Python project every day — the goal is to stay consistent, learn by doing, and have fun while improving.

Every folder in this repo is a new day, a new project, and a new lesson.

---

## 📅 Projects by Day

### ✅ Day 1: Log File Creator.
📁 [View Project](./day1_log_file/)  
🧾 A simple script that creates a daily log file with a timestamp. Perfect for journaling or tracking your progress.

---

### ✅ Day 2: Number Guessing Game.
📁 [View Project](./number_guess_game/)  
🎯 A terminal game where you guess a random number between 1 and 100. The program gives hints and counts your attempts.

---

## 🚀 Why I'm Doing This.

- To get better at writing clean Python code
- To build discipline through daily practice
- To learn by creating, not just watching tutorial
- To stay concistent
