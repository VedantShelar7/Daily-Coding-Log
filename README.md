# 🗓️ Daily Coding Log

Hey! I'm Vedant, and this repo is where I’m tracking my daily coding progress.

I started this to:
- Stay consistent with learning and coding every day
- Keep a record of what I do, even if it’s small
- Build discipline and momentum over time

---

### 💡 What’s in here?
Each day I add a log inside the `/logs` folder. It could be:
- Something new I learned
- A small bug I fixed
- A DSA problem I solved
- Notes, thoughts, or anything technical I worked on

Let’s see where this goes 👨‍💻
