# ðŸŽ¯ Number Guessing Game (Day 2 of My Coding Streak)

Todayâ€™s project is a fun little Python game where you try to guess a number between 1 and 100. The computer randomly picks a number, and you keep guessing until you get it right. It tells you if youâ€™re too high or too low â€” and it counts how many tries you take.

This is part of my daily GitHub coding streak â€” Day 2!
