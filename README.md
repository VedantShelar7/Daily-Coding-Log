# 🧠 My Daily Python Coding Streak

Welcome to my personal coding streak! I'm building one mini Python project every day — the goal is to stay consistent, learn by doing, and have fun while improving.

Every folder in this repo is a new day, a new project, and a new lesson.

## 📅 Projects by Day

### ✅ Day 1: Log File Creator
📁 [View Project](./day1_log_file/)  
🧾 A simple script that creates a daily log file with a timestamp. Perfect for journaling or tracking your progress.

---

### ✅ Day 2: Number Guessing Game
📁 [View Project](./number_guess_game/)  
🎯 A terminal game where you guess a random number between 1 and 100. The program gives hints and counts your attempts.

### ✅ Day 3: Thia dsy was big as I have created 5 python mini projects which has real world applications
📁 [View Project](./2-7-25/)  
🧠 A bundle of 5 mini Python scripts focused on mastering core concepts through practical, real-life use cases:

1. **Unit Converter** – Convert between meters, kilometers, and centimeters  
2. **Temperature Converter** – Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa  
3. **Emoji Translator** – Replaces text emojis (like :) or <3) with real ones 😄  
4. **Receipt Generator** – Builds a receipt from multiple user inputs (items & prices)  
5. **Typing Speed Test** – Calculates typing speed and accuracy in real-time

## 🚀 Why I'm Doing This

- To get better at writing clean Python code  
- To build discipline through daily practice  
- To learn by creating, not just watching tutorials  
- To stay **consistent**
